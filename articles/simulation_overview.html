<p>Clinical trial simulation (CTS) involves the generation of trial
outcomes for artificial subjects based on given inputs, data generation
models which use these inputs to generate outcome data and the
subsequent analysis of the generated dataset. The data generation model
can include models describing the time-course of disease or clinical
endpoint over the period of study in the trial and how this time-course
is affected by drug treatment. These models may be mechanistic,
reflecting biological systems 14 but they may also be empirical,
describing trends seen in the pre-existing data either from previous
clinical trials or based on meta-analysis of related literature
data.</p>
<p>CTS also requires specification of a trial design including doses
given, dosage regimens, number of subjects to be studied, how these
subjects are allocated to the different treatment arms and patient
population characteristics if these influence the outcome. Factors that
affect the trial execution such as the presence of interim analyses, and
subject level processes describing protocol adherence and missing data
are also frequently used. All of these elements can be incorporated into
a clinical trial simulation using appropriate mathematical models based
on available data. Often the mathematical models for the different
elements of the data generation process are developed separately. The
models describing these processes can often be validated only through
simulation of existing trial designs (often using existing trial data
structures ) and comparison of the resulting simulated data with the
observed data. This model validation process is essential before
embarking on simulations for novel trial designs and new scenarios.</p>
<p>The “classical” approach to clinical trial simulation is to consider
the treatment effect fixed and known - it could also conceivably
correspond to a null hypothesis - and then simulations are performed to
create random variate response observations for individual subjects
corresponding to the specific trial design scenario and data generation
inputs described above. Thus the only difference between trial
replicates is the random variability in response due to new subjects
being drawn from the random variate using the fixed treatment difference
in its mean. An alternative approach, and one that is increasingly used
in pharmacometrics for predictive simulation, involves drawing the
treatment effect (or data generation model parameters) from a
distribution of plausible values frequently derived through analysis of
prior data. Each replicate of the simulation then has a different
treatment effect or set of model parameters, and thus has a different
“true” drug effect. In this latter case we may want to know what
decision would be made for the “truth” i.e. for this particular drug
effect or set of model parameters and compare this with the decision
made for the particular trial design and analytical method</p>
<p>In CTS, the performance of different analytical methodologies can be
evaluated on the same dataset, thus enabling comparison of performance
metrics for these analytical methods using identical datasets and
comparison against the deterministic outcome for given inputs using the
data generation model (truth). The probability of making correct or
incorrect decisions (operating characteristics) can then be
characterised either using classical notions of statistical significance
and Type I and Type II errors or with reference to clinical decision
criteria around sufficient efficacy or acceptable tolerability .</p>
<p>CTS can be used to assess how often the correct dose choice would be
made for a given design, analytical method and dose-selection decision
criteria, and calibrate this against the “truth” for the current inputs
and data generation model. For a given set of inputs and data generation
model we will know what the “correct” decision would have been using the
same dose-selection criteria. Through CTS, the sensitivity of the
conclusions to changes in the data generation models, trial design or
the assumptions made in the data analytic and decision making processes
can be examined. CTS aims to answer “What if…” questions such as “What
if data are generated from a nonlinear model but then analysed assuming
a linear model?” In this case, CTS can be used to examine the robustness
of scenarios where the assumptions of the data generation and analytic
models are different, comparing these against a “base case” where
assumptions are maintained in both the data generation and data analysis
methodology.</p>
<p>When generating data in CTS it is important to understand and to be
able to quantify how different sources of variability (both random
variability and covariate effects) impact the endpoint of interest. When
we use parametric models to generate a response for an individual
subject we may wish to include covariate relationships to describe how
subjects differ e.g. response as a function of age, but if generating
repeated measures within an individual subjects, it is important to
consider which factors impact the response variables - within subject
and between subject effects. It is often helpful to think of the form of
the analytical model used to analyse such data and then reconstruct the
sources of variability between and within subjects from this model.</p>
<p>When examining the operating characteristics of trials, it is also
frequently necessary to examine the robustness of designs and analytical
methods to cases when the “base” assumptions do not hold. For example if
we make an assumption of linear response in the analysis, what are the
operating characteristics of a given trial design when we generate data
with nonlinear response?</p>
<p><code>MSToolkit</code> also allows us to examine the operating
characteristics of trials when we vary the parameters of the data
generation process between trial replicates. If we keep the parameter
values constant across trial replicates then we assume that the only
difference between trials is in the random between and within subject
effects i.e. only the patient population changes. Under this assumption
the treatment effects are fixed - which would equate to a “frequentist”
notion of fixed delta for sample sizing. If we vary the data generation
parameters between trial replicates we can extend our trial simulation
to examine a more “Bayesian” notion that the “true” treatment effect may
not be known with certainty but that the data generation process in a
future trial is driven by the current state of knowledge about the
parameters of the data generation model. Thus, when we generate
parameters for generating data, we allow users to specify not just the
mean of these parameters but a covariance matrix, specifying our between
trial replicate uncertainty in these parameters.</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of data generation then we have three levels where
sources of uncertainty and variability can enter: between trial
replicate variability, between subject variability, and within subject
variability.</p>
