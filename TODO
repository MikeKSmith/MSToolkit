##  AIMS for Dev Branch of MSToolkit:
#' Modernise documentation for MSToolkit using ROxygen2 skeletons for .R files
#'  then use {pkgdown} to create documentation website including reference
#'  pages for each function and vignettes.
#'
#' Switch test framework from {RUnit} to {testthat}.
#'
#' Improve package contents to more modern requirements from CRAN and get the
#' package ready for re-submission to CRAN.
#'
#' NOT really my intention to refactor code as a whole HOWEVER I will be
#' removing NONMEM-centric code as I don't think this is required for future
#' roadmap.

## TO DO:
#' Import .R files one by one, switch to ROxygen2 skeleton, convert tests to
#'  use {testthat} and run R CMD CHECK / build.

## DONE:
#' The following .R scripts are already updated.
