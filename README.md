# MSToolkit
MSToolkit v3.0
The MSToolkit R package has been written to help users simulate clinical trials, evaluate designs, analysis methodology and quantify operating characteristics through the application of dose and study level decision criteria. 

* Can simulate parallel group, crossover and longitudinal designs
* Flexibility in defining data generation processes using parametric models
* Data generation model parameters can vary across simulation replicates; parameters can vary between subjects
* The data generation function specifies the linear predictor for the mean response given inputs (dose, time, covariates); inverse link functions allow generation of continuous, binary and count data. User-written inverse link functions allow data generation from a variety of other distributions.
* Model parameters and covariates for each subject / replicate can be generated from multivariate normal distributions or sampled from external data files e.g. existing data files.
